# SQL

Interview questions solved with SQL from stratascratch. The website https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding has a large collection of data analysis questions
asked in interviews that can be solved using SQL and Python. The questions can be fitered by the company name as well as their difficulty levels. The website also 
hosts a youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW8Ews7tdKKkBT6GdtQaXvQ where the problem solving approach and the solutions are discussed.

I have used following resources to learn SQL.
