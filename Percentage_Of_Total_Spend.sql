Percentage Of Total Spend
-----------------------------
Find the percentage of the total spend a customer spent on each order. Output the customerâ€™s first name, order details, 
and percentage of their total spend for each order transaction rounded to the nearest whole number. Assume each customer 
has a unique first name (i.e., there is only 1 customer named Karen in the dataset).

For simplicity, let's just assume that the `order_cost` represents the total cost of the user's order for that particular 
transaction record (i.e., `order_cost` does not represent unit cost of the item).


Tables: orders, customers
--------------------------------

orders
--------------------------------
id		int
cust_id		int
order_date	datetime
order_quantity	int
order_details	varchar
order_cost	int


customers
--------------------------------
id		int
first_name	varchar
last_name	varchar
city		varchar
address		varchar
phone_number	varchar

-- approach

-- join two tables using inner join
-- using windows funtions calculate total spending of each customer
-- divide individual purachase cost by total spending to find percentage of total cost


SELECT 
    c.first_name,
    o.order_details,
    ROUND(100*o.order_cost / SUM(o.order_cost) OVER (PARTITION BY c.first_name)) AS percent_spend
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c
ON c.id = o.cust_id
ORDER BY 1;
